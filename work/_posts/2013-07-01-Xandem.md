Researched fall detection and localization using wireless sensor network for elderly care. Led development of small team to implemented real-time room-level localization algorithm using machine learning. Worked with raw wireless data to develop features for machine learning algorithm. Conducted experiments to evaluate and measure the accuracy of localization algorithm. Demonstrated working prototype to potential customers.
