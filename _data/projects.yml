    Y-Clops is an autonomous robot that uses sensors (camera, GPS, compass, and
    lidar) and path planning to navigate an obstacle course. I was one of nine
    students on the team who designed, built, and programmed Y-Clops from the
    ground up. My main responsibility was programming the camera. I used
    [OpenCV][1] to process the image data in real time to find obstacles.

    I worked with a group of students to develop a wireless security exploit.
    This exploit (called redirect attack), allows a man in the middle to block
    a redirect from an insecure website to a secure website and instead sent
    their own web page. The URL will stay the same, the only difference being
    that the website is not https, but we suspect that many normal users would
    not notice that. To find out more, you can read our [report][1].
