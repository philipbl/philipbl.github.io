- title: "Rapid prototyping tools for FPGA designs: RapidSmith"
  subtitle: FPT 2010
  worked_date: December 10, 2010
  description: >
      > Designer productivity for FPGA design is significantly limited by the
      time-consuming nature of the FPGA compilation process (synthesis, map,
      placement, and routing). However, experimentation on alternative CAD
      tools for this purpose for Xilinx devices has been somewhat limited. This
      paper describes the development and distribution of RapidSmith, a
      software library to facilitate the manipulation of XDL designs and upon
      which a complete CAD system can be based. The demonstration portion of
      this paper will show prototypes of representative CAD tools which can be
      easily built on top of the RapidSmith system.

- title: "HMFlow: Accelerating FPGA Compilation with Hard Macros for Rapid Prototyping"
  subtitle: FCCM 2011

  description: >
      > The FPGA compilation process (synthesis, map, place, and route) is a
      time consuming task that severely limits designer productivity.
      Compilation time can be reduced by saving implementation data in the form
      of hard macros. Hard macros consist of previously synthesized, placed and
      routed circuits that enable rapid design assembly because of the native
      FPGA circuitry (primitives and nets)which they encapsulate. This work
      presents results from creating a new FPGA design flow based on hard
      macros called HMF low. HMF low has shown speedups of 10-50X over the
      fastest configuration of the Xilinx tools. Designed for rapid
      prototyping, HMF low achieves these speedups by only utilizing up to 50
      percent of the resources on an FPGA and produces implementations that run
      2-4X slower than those produced by Xilinx. These speedups are obtained on
      a wide range of benchmark designs with some exceeding 18,000 slices on a
      Virtex 4 LX200.

- title: "RapidSmith: Do-It-Yourself CAD Tools for Xilinx FPGAs"
  subtitle: FPL 2011
  worked_date: September 7, 2011
  description: >
      > Creating CAD tools for commercial FPGAs is a difficult task. Closed
      proprietary device databases and unsupported interfaces are largely to
      blame for the lack of CAD research found on commercial architectures
      versus hypothetical architectures. This paper formally introduces
      RapidSmith, a new set of tools and APIs that enable CAD tool creation for
      Xilinx FPGAs. Based on the Xilinx Design Language (XDL), RapidSmith
      provides a compact, yet, fast device database with hundreds of APIs that
      enable the creation of placers, routers and several other tools for
      Xilinx devices. RapidSmith alleviates several of the difficulties of
      using XDL and this work demonstrates the kinds of research facilitated by
      removing such challenges.

- title: "WiFu: A Composable Toolkit for Experimental Wireless Transport Protocols"
  subtitle: MASS 2012
  worked_date: October 9, 2012
  description: >
      > Extensive research has been performed on improving TCP performance in
      multi-hop wireless networks, but there have been relatively few
      experimental evaluations of this work. To make it easier to conduct
      research in this area, we are releasing WiFu, an open-source toolkit for
      developing experimental wireless transport protocols. WiFu provides for
      user-space development of reliable transport and rate control algorithms,
      greatly simplifying the implementation effort required. In this paper, we
      describe the architecture of the WiFu toolkit, which decomposes transport
      protocols into smaller components that enable rapid, plug-and-play
      development of new variants. We present experiments to demonstrate that
      the performance of WiFu compares favorably to the Linux kernel for
      wireless networks. We illustrate the utility of WiFu by using it to
      conduct experiments with several wireless transport protocols, and show
      that the performance of some protocols differs significantly from
      previously reported results.
