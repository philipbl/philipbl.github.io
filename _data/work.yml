    Worked on DARPA's Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking (CBMEN) project
    using Android phones. Improved, measured, and tested the design of the
    basic ad hoc networking functionality. Thoroughly studied the benefits of
    using asynchronous I/O compared to synchronous I/O for all network
    communication. Developed new method for managing multiple TCP connections
    with neighboring nodes. Built Android application and deployed on 15
    devices in the field to measure the improvements. Collaborated closely with
    three other researchers to improve various components of the system.
