title: Hi, I'm Phil

    I like playing with computers and spending time with my family. My main
    passion is wireless networks, which is what I am studying at the
    [University of Utah](http://www.cs.utah.edu).

    When I am not doing school work I am working on various [programming
    projects](/projects/). I am a Python fanatic and also enjoy learning other
    programming languages. I am constantly looking for new things to learn to
    make me a better programmer.
