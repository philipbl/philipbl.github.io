        I was born in the sunny city of Santa Cruz, CA. I have many childhood memories playing on the beach and going to the [board walk][1]. It was a great place to grow up. When I was 8 years old, my family moved to Redmond, WA. Though quite a bit different than Santa Cruz, I loved it. Possibliy out of necessity, I quickly grew to love cloudy, rainy days and still do to this day. Living in Microsoft's home town gave me a passion for technology. I took my first programming class in high school (with some impromptu Java courses from my Dad) and the rest is history.


        After graduating highschool, I went to [Brigham Young University][2] (BYU). I went for a year, and then served a full time mission for [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints][3] (LDS) in Santa Rosa, CA for two years. After my mission, I returned to BYU and got my degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
