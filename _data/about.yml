        For my undergrad, I went to [Brigham Young University][2] (BYU). I went for a year, and then served a full time mission for [the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints][3] (LDS) in Santa Rosa, CA for two years. After my mission, I returned to BYU and received a degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My junior year, I worked with Professor [Brent Nelson][4] and Professor [Brad Hutchings][5] in the [FPGA Lab][6]. I researched rapid prototyping of FPGAs. My senior year, I worked with Professor [Daniel Zappala][7], working on a new transport protocol specifically designed for ad hoc networks.

        For graduate school, I am going to the [University of Utah][8]. My advisor is [Sneha Kasera][9]. I am finishing my third year as a PhD student. My main research interests lie in wireless network management.

        I was born in the sunny city of Santa Cruz, CA. I have many childhood memories playing on the beach and going to the [beach board walk][1]. It was a great place to grow up. When I was 8 years old, my family moved to Redmond, WA. Though quite a bit different than Santa Cruz, I loved it. Possibliy out of necessity, I quickly grew to love cloudy, rainy days and still do to this day. Living in Microsoft's home town gave me a passion for technology. Each summer in junior high and high school, I would teach myself something new like HTML, Java, Adobe Flash, Adobe Fireworks, etc. I took my first offical programming class in high school (with some impromptu Java courses from my Dad) and the rest is history.

        While at BYU, I married [Bridget Toohey Lunn][1]. We have lived a few places in the valley, but have finally ended up in Salt Lake City. We have a son, Henry, that was born in December 2013. Bridget is studying sociology of the family at [Utah Valley University][2] (UVU).

        When I am not with my family, I love to program. I love any and all programming. I have been using Java for the longest, but I think I have written more things in Python. Python is my go-to language for any task. [Recently][3], I have been getting interesting in functional programming languages. A recent passion of mine has been to learn a new programming language when I work on a project. I always have more ideas for projects than I have time for.
