I decided to invest some time into developing a Day One Quick Look plug-in. I did this for a couple of reasons. First, I wanted to see what it was like to develop a Quick Look plug-in. I figured it would be fairly easy since there are a few open source Markdown Quick Look plug-ins and Day One uses Markdown (inside of a plist -- more on that later). The second reason I made this plug-in is because I was getting tired of looking through my Day One entries in Finder and seeing a giant ribbon (Day One's icon for an entry) when I tired to Quick Look it.

As I mentioned earlier, there are a few Markdown Quick Look plug-ins that already exist. I decided to base my plug-in on Brett Terpstra's [MultiMarkdown Quick Look with Style](https://github.com/ttscoff/MMD-QuickLook).

1. Add day one extension to work with .doentry
2. Remove plist information
3. Add styling from Day One (with date and weather)
