I have been working on a plug-in for [Lightroom][1] to export pictures to [Day One][2]. I was annoyed that I had to export pictures from Lightroom and then import those pictures into Day One, so I decided to create a plug-in that automated the process for me. The plug-in is still in development, but it is coming along nicely. For more information or to download and use it, you can go to the [github page][3]. Feel free to let me know if you run into any problems.
