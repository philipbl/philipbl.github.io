Y-Clops is an autonomous robot that uses sensors (camera, GPS, compass, and lidar) and path planning to navigate an obstacle course. I was one of nine students on the team who designed, built, and programmed Y-Clops from the ground up. My main responsibility was programming the camera. I used [OpenCV][1] to process the image data in real time to find obstacles.
