I worked with a group of students to develop a wireless security exploit. This exploit (called redirect attack), allows a man in the middle to block a redirect from an insecure website to a secure website and instead sent their own web page. The URL will stay the same, the only difference being that the website is not https, but we suspect that many normal users would not notice that. To find out more, you can read our [report][1].
